Playing around with `System.Collections.Generic.PriorityQueue` to implement Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest route.  
Implementation is based on [this article](https://andrewlock.net/implementing-dijkstras-algorithm-for-finding-the-shortest-path-between-two-nodes-using-priorityqueue-in-dotnet-9/).
